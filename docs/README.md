# react-inky

react-inky is a port of [Inky](https://github.com/zurb/inky), a templating language for writing HTML emails with [Foundation for Emails](http;//foundation.zurb.com/emails). Writing a structurally sound HTML email requires a lot of HTML will a complex and specific table structure. Inky wraps up that structure into a set of simple HTML tags like `<row>`, `<column>`, and `<button>`, and converts them to the required tables. react-inky is a port of those custom components to React. With React's server-side rendering, you can produce email templates as React components with dynamic props.

To get started, [install the library](setup.md), brush up on the few [differences from the original Inky](differences.md), and then take a look at some [example templates](examples.md).
